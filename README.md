# SaveData

What: My Unity project allows you to save and load Data from a JSON file. 

How: When you run the scene in Unity you can set how much gold/what items you have in your inventory. If you hit S, the data will save, if you then exit and reload the scene, hitting L will load your previously saved data.

Reflection: Some benefits to JSON is that its easy to implement and works quickly. Some drawbacks are that by default it's really easy to modify, therefore making it easy to cheat. JSON Files are lightwieght, human readable, and compatible with any platform. If you chose to go a different route than JSOn you can use tex-files or SQL, Unity also has PlayerPrefs.
